# Database and API Integration Script

## Overview
This Python script is designed to connect to a SQL Server database, execute a SELECT query to retrieve specific order IDs, and then use these IDs to make requests to an external API. The script handles the response from the API, parses XML content, and updates the database with the relevant tracking numbers.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `pyodbc` package for database connectivity
- `requests` package for making HTTP requests
- `xml.etree.ElementTree` for parsing XML data
- Access to a SQL Server database
- API access credentials

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install pyodbc requests

## Configuration
Replace the placeholder credentials in the script with your actual database and API credentials:

- YOUR_SERVER: Your database server address
- YOUR_DATABASE: The name of your database
- YOUR_USERNAME: Your database username
- YOUR_PASSWORD: Your database password
- YOUR_API_USERNAME: Your API username
- YOUR_API_PASSWORD: Your API password
- YOUR_EMAIL: Your email associated with the API
- YOUR_PASSWORD: Your password associated with the API
